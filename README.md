# 🧠 DeepDetect: DeepFake Face Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project presents a comparative analysis of three different models for deepfake image detection, focusing specifically on **face images**. Deepfakes pose a significant threat in the digital world due to their ability to produce highly realistic fabricated visuals. This work evaluates and benchmarks multiple approaches to understand which model performs best for detecting manipulated human faces.
